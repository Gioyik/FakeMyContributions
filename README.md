# Fake Github contributions
Let people (and recruiters :-)) think you work hard on GitHub.

## How to make it work
- Create a GitHub account (Example: `awesome-user`) or use one already created
- Create a repo for that user (Example: `contributions-repo`)
- Clone the repo on your computer
- Add `contributions` to your repo and modify with the dates you "did" contributions
- Add `fakeit.sh` to your repo folder and modify `--author="Gioyik"` with the username of your Github account (Ex: `--author="awesome-user"`)
- Run `git init` if your repo is not initialized
- Run `./fakeit.sh`
- Run `git push`.
- Visit your user page to see the activity chart
